        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Okay, it’s still 90 degrees here but in the morning it’s 60 degrees so I believe that’s cause to celebrate. So I’m declaring it soup weather. I’m working like crazy on a lot of fun comfort food recipes for y’all so there’s plenty more to come.</p>
                        
            <p>When I say this 30 Minute Dairy Free Potato Soup is creamy I mean it’s really truly very creamy. It’s a blended soup and that blender makes everything perfectly smooth. You’ll also set aside one cup of diced potatoes to add back in after you’ve blended the rest. We need a few chunks of potato too, right?</p>

            <p>Did you catch the part about this being dairy free? I typically avoid potato soup in restaurants because I know they’re full of milk and cheese. Not this one! This means my version is less calories but I’m betting you won’t be able to tell.</p>

            <p>Since I’m not using milk the creaminess of this soup comes from a cup of unsweetened canned coconut milk. It doesn’t give the soup any coconut flavor at all!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2.5 lbs potatoes, <em>russet, yellow, or gold potatoes work best, peeled and diced</em></li>
                <li>oz chicken stock or broth</li> 
                <li>1/2 white or yellow onion, <em>sliced</em></li>
                <li>1 cup canned coconut milk, <em>unsweetened</em></li>
                <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp dried thyme or dried chives</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add chicken stock, onion, and potatoes (peeled and diced into 1 inch cubes) to a soup pot. Bring to boiling and cook for approximately 5 – 8 minutes or until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork. Be careful to not overcook your potatoes or you'll end up decreasing the amount of chicken stock you have.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, remove 1 cup of the diced potatoes from chicken stock. Set aside in a separate dish.</li>
                <li> Blend the diced potatoes (excluding the 1 cup you set aside), onion, chicken stock, and 1 cup canned coconut milk until smooth. </li>
                <li>Pour the blended soup back into your pot. Add the 1 cup diced potatoes you set aside earlier, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and dried thyme (or dried chives). Stir.</li>
                <li>Ladle the finished soup into bowls and top with fresh chopped chives and crispy bacon.</li>
            </ol>
